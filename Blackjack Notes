Blackjack Notes

-Need to scaffold webpack and babble to run ES6 and bundle code
-using partypack for this scaffolding
	- npm run develop
	- cannot have 2 instances running on same port
	- needed to install 
		- path
		- babel
		- babel-core
		- babel-loader
		- babel-preset-es2015 ==> npm install --save-dev babel-preset-es2015
	- webpack.dev.config.js
		- this is the config for web pack in dev
		- needed to change the loader to babel-loader loader: 'babel-loader'
	- Added to package.json
		"babel": {
		    "presets": [
		      "es2015",
		      "react"
		    ]
		  }
	- port is in server.js
